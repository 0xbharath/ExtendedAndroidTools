Default version: 40d36888e76de0fb1abb712f629e7059664a7dc2
- 40d36888e76de0fb1abb712f629e7059664a7dc2 added support for libs mmapped
  directly from zip archives.

Building:
- cmake depends on flex binary, which needs to stay in sync with flex header
  and library we built for Android (using host flex won't work). We build
  flex for host from the same sources as we do for android and we override
  the binary used by cmake with -DFLEX_EXECUTABLE
- bps is linked against librt, which on Android is not available and instead
  librt functions are provided by bionic
