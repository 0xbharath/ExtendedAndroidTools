Default version: dcd8a9adf9972d819505cbf1c0957f06f528b131
- dcd8a9adf9972d819505cbf1c0957f06f528b131 makes bcc use /sys/kernel/tracing
  when /sys/kernel/debug/tracing is not available
- aa1f7cbfc276896b08f94ebe1a1436b8c7019406 makes bcc extract kernel headers
  to /data/local/tmp/... instead of /tmp/...

Building:
- cmake depends on flex binary, which needs to stay in sync with flex header
  and library we built for Android (using host flex won't work). We build
  flex for host from the same sources as we do for android and we override
  the binary used by cmake with -DFLEX_EXECUTABLE
- bps is linked against librt, which on Android is not available and instead
  librt functions are probided by bionic
