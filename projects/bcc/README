Toolkit for creating BPF based tracing tools.

Default version: 581b198cffb55a7dd6486e54007df25e57feb466
Master as of 7/2/2020. We're choosing master over most recent release in order
to work around the following issues:
- 581b198cffb55a7dd6486e54007df25e57feb466 fixes memleak on Android

Building:
- cmake depends on flex binary, which needs to stay in sync with flex header
  and library we built for Android (using host flex won't work). We build
  flex for host from the same sources as we do for android and we override
  the binary used by cmake with -DFLEX_EXECUTABLE
- bps is linked against librt, which on Android is not available and instead
  librt functions are probided by bionic
- bits/reg.h header is missing on Android and we provide a stub defining
  __WORDSIZE
- stl we're building against provides implementation of std::make_unique,
  __cpp_lib_make_unique needs to be defined
