BPF Compiler Collection (BCC)
github:https://github.com/iovisor/bcc
Toolkit for creating BPF based tracing tools.

Default version: v0.24.0

Building:
- cmake depends on flex binary, which needs to stay in sync with flex header
  and library we built for Android (using host flex won't work). We build
  flex for host from the same sources as we do for android and we override
  the binary used by cmake with -DFLEX_EXECUTABLE
- bps is linked against librt, which on Android is not available and instead
  librt functions are probided by bionic
