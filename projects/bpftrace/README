Default version: e6bbb9a925e405c1ec87790490d81227ac122032
Master as of 11/03/2020. We're building master rather than the most recent
release to work around problems with probe_read and probe_read_str not being
able to read userspace memory (1ab30bc872bc9fd078a9f65be86e7de495a40aa7).

Building:
- bpftrace depends on bcc and needs to be told where to look for headers
  (cmake's -DLIBBCC_INCLUDE_DIRS)
- we need to tell cmake to use flex version that matches the lib and
  headers we have for Android. We set FLEX_EXECUTABLE to point to
  host executable built from the same sources as we use for Android.
- bpftrace links against stdc++fs which is not available in NDK yet.
  Fortunately there are some experimental headers available and we can work
  around this problem by providing toy implementation of stdc++fs providing
  minimal functionality making bpftrace work
