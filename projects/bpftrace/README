bpftrace
High-level tracing language for Linux eBPF
github: https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace

Default version: 954049043568350af934275202d4414f0f800db7
Before 954049043568350af934275202d4414f0f800db7 bpftrace would limit its VA
to 1GB in order to curb llvm's allocations. This causes problems with Android R
emulators, where bpftrace process starts with over 1GB of VA.

Building:
- bpftrace depends on bcc and needs to be told where to look for headers
  (cmake's -DLIBBCC_INCLUDE_DIRS)
- we need to tell cmake to use flex version that matches the lib and
  headers we have for Android. We set FLEX_EXECUTABLE to point to
  host executable built from the same sources as we use for Android.
