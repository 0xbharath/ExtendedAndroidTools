Default version: 7175447d8dfad8e431bf224847242cc7307ba0da
Master as of 7/2/2020. We're building master rather than the most recent release
to work around following issues:
- before 954049043568350af934275202d4414f0f800db7 bpftrace would limit its VA
  to 1GB in order to curb llvm's allocations. This causes problems with Android
  R emulators, where bpftrace process starts with over 1GB of VA.
- 766209727bad36af75bb1095a623c535b933ab85 fixes compilation against master bcc
  which we need to work around other Android specific issues

Building:
- bpftrace depends on bcc and needs to be told where to look for headers
  (cmake's -DLIBBCC_INCLUDE_DIRS)
- we need to tell cmake to use flex version that matches the lib and
  headers we have for Android. We set FLEX_EXECUTABLE to point to
  host executable built from the same sources as we use for Android.
