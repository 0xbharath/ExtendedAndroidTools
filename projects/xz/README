XZ Utils
XZ Utils is free general-purpose data compression software with a high compression ratio.

Default version: v5.2.5

- XZ Utils builds without problems, however autogen runs into problems specific
  to VirtualBox's file system for shared directories, so it needs to be run in a
  temporary location.
- We need to ensure built executables are position independent
