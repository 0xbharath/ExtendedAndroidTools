Default version: v3.6.8
https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/v3.6.8

Building:
- configure scripts needs to be told explicitely what the build environment is
  (--build=x86_64)
- due to lack of libs we need to disable ipv6 (--disable-ipv6)
- PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR needs to be exported so that it is visible in processes
  spawned by the configure script
